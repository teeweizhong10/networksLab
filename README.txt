Compilation: While in the appropriate directory, users will have to compile the three executables using the following commands, ‘make network’, ‘make sender’, and ‘make receiver’.
•Execution: Once all three executable files are compiled the user can run the executables. Users MUST run the network executable first using: ‘./network’. The user will read through the prompts and assign which server the receiver executable will run on. Once finished, the user will then run the receiver executable on the specified server using the command: ‘./receiver’. Lastly the user must navigate back to the previous server and run ‘./sender’.
•Checking OUTPUTFILE: Once the protocols are done transmitting packets, they will rebuild the sent file into a file called ‘OUTPUTFILE’. The user can check that the rebuilt file has the same content as the transmitted file using the md5sum command. To do this, the user can enter ‘md5sum OUTPUTFILE’ and similarly with the specified data input file like so,  ‘md5sum [FILENAME]’.
